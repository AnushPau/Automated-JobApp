A clean, standalone script that stores your profile data locally and automatically applies to LinkedIn Easy Apply jobs. No backend, no API - just a simple Python script that does the job!

## üéØ **What This Does**

1. **Stores your data locally** (JSON files - no database needed)
2. **Searches LinkedIn** for Easy Apply jobs matching your criteria
3. **Automatically fills applications** using your saved profile data
4. **Tracks applied jobs** to avoid duplicates
5. **Works completely offline** - no external services required

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

üîß Troubleshooting
Common Issues
1. Login Failed

Check your LinkedIn email/password
Disable 2FA on LinkedIn (or handle manually)
Try logging in manually first to clear security challenges
2. No Jobs Found

Try broader job titles ("developer" instead of "senior python developer")
Remove location filters or try "remote"
Check if you've already applied to most available jobs
3. Applications Not Submitting

Some jobs have custom forms not covered by the script
LinkedIn may have updated their form structure
Run in non-headless mode (--headless off) to see what's happening
4. Profile Not Loading

Run --setup again to recreate your profile
Check that linkedin_profile.json has valid JSON syntax
Ensure all required fields are filled
Debug Mode
Run without headless to see the browser:

python linkedin_auto_apply.py --email EMAIL --password PASS --job-title "developer"
# (removes --headless flag so you can see what's happening)

üìù Best Practices
1. Start Small
Begin with --max-apps 3-5 to test
Use specific job titles first
Monitor the first few runs
2. Optimize Profile
Complete all profile fields for better matching
Use a professional email address
Keep cover letter concise but engaging
3. Smart Scheduling
Run 2-3 times per day maximum
Space out runs by several hours
Avoid peak LinkedIn usage hours
4. Job Search Strategy
Use varied job titles ("developer", "engineer", "programmer")
Try different locations and remote options
Focus on recently posted jobs (script does this automatically)
